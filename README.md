## Inspiration
•	What can we learn about different hosts and areas? <br>
•	What can we learn from predictions? (ex: locations, prices, reviews, etc) <br>
•	Which hosts are the busiest and why? <br>
•	Is there any noticeable difference of traffic among different areas and what could be the reason for it? <br>
The inspiration for my analysis are the questions below <br>
•	Which are the famous neighborhoods and neighborhood groups among the listings? <br>
•	What is the price range of the listings? <br>
•	What are the mst common words used in the description? <br>
•	Which room types are usually busy ? Is the trend different in different neighborhoods? <br>
•	How are the reviews distributed? <br>
